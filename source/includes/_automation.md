This endpoint accepts a visitor message and responds with a bot response and attached actions. 
A response could be a simple text reply or a dialog which includes multiple messages.
In the current API version, the only action supported is a param that flags whether the conversation should be “escalated” (meaning- the agent owning the conversation should be changed from bot to human agent / human department).
